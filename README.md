// it askes your name and what time you woke up and then tell you your name and what time you woke up

I tried out Mark's program and while it works, I was confussed when it asked me for a minute. I added a minute of 93, and then it told me I woke up at 83:93. The program is very basic, but it meets the requirement of the assignment. I know Mark can do some great coding, but this program just not reflecting that.
